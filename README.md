# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

My name is Josh Jestine. I am an AI graduate student, software developer, and machine learning practitioner with a strong interest in applied artificial intelligence, system design, and data-driven engineering. My work spans reinforcement learning, computer vision, predictive modeling, automation pipelines, and classical as well as deep-learning–based generative systems.

I enjoy building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems, studying the mathematical foundations of machine learning, and exploring modern tools that push the boundaries of automation and human–computer interaction.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, where my academic focus includes machine learning, unsupervised learning, algorithms, AI for human–computer interaction, and modern programming paradigms. My long-term goal is to design AI systems that integrate intelligent decision-making with scalable engineering, enabling automation across industries, research, and creative domains.
